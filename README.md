# JOURNEY MANAGEMENT APP 
 
# Goal of the project 

The aim of this project was to create a journey management application.
The idea was to be able to insert routes linking one city to another, potentially with stages and means of transport between each stage.
The aim was also to be able to search and delete these routes.
The idea was also to have a function for exporting routes from the application, as well as a function for importing a large file of routes into the application.
